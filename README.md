## 🎲 About intelligence
🧠 This engine has learned only with **16K self-play** with the **reinforcement learning** method, it can be further developed if desired.

- **Current State:** 🦊 This engine is **a brilliant tactician**; thanks to its neural networks, it has a **cunning** habit of trapping you in forks. 

- **The Challenge:** 🪨 trained with a **7-year-old laptop**


## 🚀 Features
- **Neural Engine:** Powered by Stable Baselines3 and Gymnasium infrastructure.
- **Modern UI:** A modern, simple and stylish GUI interface.

- **Our Goal:** 🚩 We aim to build an engine with a **+1 million neuron neural network** and bring **optimization updates.**
